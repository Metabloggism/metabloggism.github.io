# Introduction of SHORTS

In this post I am introducing the new type of posts, SHORTS. Eventually, I will insert the key SHORT in some of my posts. This will indicate that this post is a SHORT post. SHORT posts will be posts that will not go in depth but still will talk about some interesting topic I want to intoduce. They will be lighter posts that aim to be read in around 10 minutes. The scope is the same as in the rest of the posts, but may be more achievable by the general audience due to its length. The topics may be toy ideas or tools of interests, keeping always ML in our focus.
